# Topic of Love
**..is a WorldBox mod that allows units to have intimacy and fall in love for more than just their ability to reproduce! If you want a Sims-like experience with your units, this may be the mod!**

## 📩 Installation
If downloading through GitHub or GameBanana, download the latest release and extract the contents into a folder in "worldbox/Mods"

If downloading through Steam, subscribe to the mod and you're good to go!

When enabling or disabling the mod, restarting the game is a must otherwise you will run into issues extremely quickly.

## ➕ Main Features
### New Behaviors
- Units no longer instantly fall in love with the first person they see. Rather, they socialize, which can lead to dates, copulating, and then can possibly lead to falling in love!

- Units have preferences! Some women prefer women, men, or don't even like romance and copulating! Sometimes these preferences change over time too!

### Intimacy
Intimacy is a new stat (find it in the unit's statistics!) and need that units will actively try to maintain. Whether in the form of socializing, following others, dating, copulating, kissing, etc, they will do what they can to feel loved!

When intimacy is low, units are likely to break up or cheat on their partners. Here's an example of what that may look like:

Take the person Jamie, a heterosexual heteroromantic male. Say his intimacy levels are getting low, and say he wants to copulate with his wife. But, his wife rejects him either because she is homosexual or she has a high enough intimacy level, or she just does not want it.

Jamie may then find other people to copulate with or go on dates with because HOW dare he not receive the intimacy that he so wants?! If other people accept his offers, they may do the deed, date, kiss, whatever, and that would result in Jamie's wife getting mad. She might go after him with murderous rage, or break down in tears, who knows?  This is just one example of how intimacy plays into a unit's life.

How romance and sexual actions are decided is based on these factors:
- Whether the two people involved are lovers
- Whether both peoples' preferences match
- Random chance based on intimacy levels for both parties
- Whether there will be repercussions or not
- Whether they are for purely reproduction purposes
- Whether it is a sexual or romantic act that is involved
- Even more that I may have forgotten! (This feature is super indepth)

More over.. not all units will enjoy every copulating. The enjoyment of a unit's copulating is based on random chance and their sexual preferences. If they dislike it, their intimacy levels may decrease! If they love it, their intimacy levels skyrocket! See on how this can be result in more cheating and so on and so forth?

### New Traits

#### Culture Traits
- Procreationist : These units believe that love is only to reproduce. Thus, preferences do not matter and instead whether they can reproduce with their partner is what matters most!
- Homophobic : This culture despises units who are homosexual in any way.
- Heterophobic : This culture despises units who are heterosexual in any way.
- Committed : This culture believes that no matter how bad a relationship gets, lovers will stick together till their deaths.
- Mature Dating : It is despicable for units to fall in love with someone much younger or older than them.
- Sexual Expectations : A lover expectation that if both lovers do not prefer each other sexually, then they are allowed to copulate with others that do fit their preferences without it being considered cheating.

## ❓ FAQ
- I found a bug or I want to suggest something!
  - First of, I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to help out the mod. That means a lot to me as a developer! [You can find the link here](https://github.com/MianReplicate/Topic-of-Love/issues)
- When two different species are involved in a pregnancy, will the baby's species be a mix of both?
  - At the moment, a baby will inherit one random species from their parents. This may change in the future.
