# Topic of Love
**..is a WorldBox mod that allows units to have intimacy and fall in love for more than just their ability to reproduce! If you want a Sims-like experience with your units, this may be the mod!**

## 📩 Installation
The mod is not technically **finished** or **complete** yet according to my roadmap. As such, more bugs may show up than intended!  It is, however, completed and bug free enough to the point where it can be used as expected :)

Make sure to have NML installed! Their instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/WorldBoxOpenMods/ModLoader/blob/master/README.md).

If downloading through GitHub or GameBanana, download the latest release and extract the contents into a folder in "worldbox/Mods"

~~If downloading through Steam, subscribe to the mod and you're good to go!~~

When enabling or disabling the mod, restarting the game is a must otherwise you will run into issues extremely quickly.

## ➕ Main Features
### New Behaviors
- Some units no longer instantly fall in love with the first person they see. Rather, they socialize, which can lead to dates, copulating, and then can possibly lead to falling in love!

- Units have preferences! Some women prefer women, men, or don't even like romance and copulating! Sometimes these preferences change over time too!

- Units who cannot reproduce with their lovers may resort to sexual ivf to make babies!
- Units can cheat and breakup with one another! (More on that in **Intimacy**)

### Intimacy
Intimacy is a new stat (find it in the unit's statistics!) and need that units will actively try to maintain. Whether in the form of socializing, following others, dating, copulating, kissing, etc, they will do what they can to feel loved!

When intimacy is low, units are likely to break up or cheat on their partners. Here's an example of what that may look like:

Take the person Jamie, a heterosexual heteroromantic male. Say his intimacy levels are getting low, and say he wants to copulate with his wife. But, his wife rejects him either because she is homosexual or she has a high enough intimacy level, or she just does not want it.

Jamie may then find other people to copulate with or go on dates with because HOW dare he not receive the intimacy that he so wants?! If other people accept his offers, they may do the deed, date, kiss, whatever, and that would result in Jamie's wife getting mad. She might go after him with murderous rage, or break down in tears, who knows?  This is just one example of how intimacy plays into a unit's life.

How romance and sexual actions are decided is based on these factors:
- Whether the two people involved are lovers
- Whether both peoples' preferences match
- Random chance based on intimacy levels for both parties
- Whether there will be repercussions or not
- Whether they are for purely reproduction purposes
- Whether it is a sexual or romantic act that is involved
- Even more that I may have forgotten! (This feature is super indepth)

More over.. not all units will enjoy every copulating. The enjoyment of a unit's copulating is based on random chance and their sexual preferences. If they dislike it, their intimacy levels may decrease! If they love it, their intimacy levels skyrocket! See on how this can be result in more cheating and so on and so forth?

### New Traits
#### Culture Traits
- Preservation : Sexual reproduction is never considered cheating by any means!
- Sacred Copulating : Copulating is only for making babies! What, you don't copulate just to make babies? Ewwww, you're disgusting! /j 
- Procreationist : These units believe that love is only to reproduce. Thus, preferences do not matter and instead whether they can reproduce with their partner is what matters most!
- Homophobic : This culture despises units who are homosexual in any way.
- Heterophobic : This culture despises units who are heterosexual in any way.
- Mature Dating : It is despicable for units to fall in love with someone much younger or older than them.
- Sexual Expectations : A lover expectation that if both lovers do not prefer each other sexually, then they are allowed to copulate with others that do fit their preferences without it being considered cheating.

#### Actor Traits
- Unfluid : This unit's preferences will never change even over time.
- Intimacy-Averse : This unit does not require intimacy to function. As such, their actions in relationships, whether cheating, or breaking up, will not be impacted by intimacy. 
- Faithful : This unit will never cheat.
- Unfaithful : This unit is more likely to cheat than your average Joe.

## ❓ FAQ
- I found a bug or I want to suggest something!
  - First of, I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to help out the mod. That means a lot to me as a developer! [You can find the link here](https://github.com/MianReplicate/Topic-of-Love/issues)
- When two different species are involved in a pregnancy, will the baby's species be a mix of both?
  - At the moment, a baby will inherit one random species from their parents. This may change in the future.
- Why did you make this mod?
  - As someone who was eager to play the new WorldBox update, I was excited to find that a new lover system was implemented! I.. however.. was not excited to find out that two different species could not fall in love, and that two people could not fall in love if they could not make babies together! My love for the Lumity ship from The Owl House is so strong that I made this mod <3. Oh, and queer representation is always nice.
- How was the process of making this mod?
  - This is my first modding WorldBox and a Unity game, sooo it was tough at first, but I got through it using documentation and help from the WorldBox discord <3. There are times where certain features were tough to add due to the game's codebase, but I was able to walk around them with some methods (at the cost of efficiency but shhh!). Due to making this mod, I've gotten much better at using tools such as dnSpy, Harmony (a patcher that modifies methods), C# as a whole, and well.. modding Unity games!

- Rimworld mods such as, Edges of Acceptance, Way Better Romance, Romance on the Rim and Intimacy - A Lovin' Expansion. Thanks to them for inspiring me to make this mod
- The Lumity ship for literally being why I wanted to make this in the first place (literally having other sapient species dating each other is awesome)
- The Athena Coding Event for giving me motivation to work on the mod
- To all the queers out there in the world, you are wonderful and are absolutely valid <3
- And finally.. a big thank you to Maxim, mastef, and the rest of the WorldBox team for making update 0.50.0 and for making WorldBox.

## 💌 A Message
The topic of love is truly a beautiful thing. Whether platonic or romantic, everyone should be able to love who they want without consequence.

You are valid, no matter who you love. 💖
